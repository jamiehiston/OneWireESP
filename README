This is a port of the OneWire.h library used in Arduino projects, for the ESP-IDF
It only supports 1 bus at the moment (I will be adding support for more) but you
can add multiple yourself using the same principal. I've deliberately named
variables as DIRECT_READ1 (for example) to make it easier to know what needs
duplicating and renumbering for multiple buses. I will be adding support later,
but for now its a bit basic. Still if you're anything like me then this library
will be super helpful because there's no port of it that I know of.

====================================
== TO DEFINE THE PIN FOR YOUR BUS ==
====================================
Go into the OneWireESP.h file and change gpio_num_9 to whatever pin you're using.
The ESP framework is different to Arduino in that it's not a straight number definition,
and you need to use this enum format i.e. gpio_num_1 for pin 1, etc.

In main.cpp, declare the bus as you normally would. Use OneWire ow(OW1_PIN); for example
this would mean your bus name (configurable by you) is named ow. OW1_PIN is the important
bit and can't change. Sadly it needs to be done this way and defined in the header file
due to the way GPIO pins are defined as enums in the ESP IDF, rather than integers like in
Arduino.
